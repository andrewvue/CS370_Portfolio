My SNHU CS370 - Current and Emerging Trends portfolio

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given the initial starter code for the pirate game that contains the GameExperience, TreasureHuntGame, and TreasureMaze files. The GameExperience file is to store the agent's progress. The TreasureMaze file contains the coordinates used for the puzzle game and the TreasureHuntGame contains a few parameters and instructions set for me to create a program for the Agent to solve the puzzle.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists find solutions and solve problems using technology. Similar to other scientists and mathematicians, Computer scientists create programs, algorithms and test theories both with hardware and software. This matters because the results are beneificial to many different fields. An example in class was the AlphaGo program that shows the different approaches to machine learning. These results can be beneficial to the medical field in creating vaccines and enhancing medical practices with the use of data.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach a problem as a computer scientist by trying to understand the initial question. Only after understanding the question can we think of possible solutions or improvements to existing solutions.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to reduce waste, respect privacy and ensure security to name a few. The importance of user and organization data privacy and security is paramnount in the digital age. There are data breaches daily and the costs of these breaches are only increasing. The end user needs to be able to understand what their data is being used for and their privacy should be respected. In the USA we don't have privacy laws as strict as the EU with their The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but their privacy should still be respected to ensure trust.
